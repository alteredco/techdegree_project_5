# Features:
This app requests a JSON object from the the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/)and parses the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

**FOR EXCEEDS**

• Has a search feature that filters the results directory by name. The API request has been adjusted to retrieve a user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet.

• Has active buttons to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open.

• Fonts, colors have been customised and box-shadows added. Plus the API has been adjusted to retrieve lego profile photos.
